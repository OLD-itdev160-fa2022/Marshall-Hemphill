            <p class="review-content">This laptop is built extremely well. I bought this at $800. The display could be a bit brighter. When you do turn the
            brightness all the way up the battery life tanks. The i5 gets hot under load and the fans kick in to the max when under
            load. There is a bit of display flickering. But overall serves my use cases very well, which are academics and
            entertainment. The pen input is a lifesaver when conducting classes online.</p>
